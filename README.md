## Wine & Dine

## Description

This application is a one-stop shop database for meals and drinks, designed for user who is hungry or thirsty and wants a nice quick meal or an adult beverage food and beverage. The application is a user-friendly application that gives the user several recipes and/or ingredients on how to make the food they desire or cocktails. If the user is hungry and does not want to have a drink the application will provide food options and remove the drink options and also if the user wants an alcoholic drink but does not want food, it will remove the food option and only show drink options. The motivation behind this project was to create a modern day cookbook with edge. We aimed to make it easy for someone to have recipes at their fingers and to use one application for both needs rather than using a search engine that will pull up many different results, which can become cumbersome and frustrating.

## Usage

The application allows users the opportunity to begin on a homepage with food and drink options (wine & dine). It leads with a message saying "Wine & Dine"
and with instructions for the user to click "Let's Eat" and "Let's Drink". Once the user clicks one of these options he or she is then presented with a new web page with a form submission box to search for the food item or drink item of choice. The website allows the user to search via ingredient or recipe. The user is then presented with meal or drink (adult) items that are relatable or contains the suggested menu item, i.e. chicken. Once the user selects the food option or drink option within the choices of relatable choices they are then presented with ingredients or the recipe of the selected option.
